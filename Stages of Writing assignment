1 Intro: 
  After weighing in for my boxing match, the coach made sure I drank some coconut water to "recover" from cutting weight. And 
  so I thought "how does a coconut even help recovery?" Being closer to a drupe rather than a nut, the coconut is a fruit that 
  comes from palm trees called the cocos nucifera. There are 3 layers to the cococnut; the husk, the hard shell, and the inside
  fleshy part. Although people gernally think of food when it comes to the coconut, it's actually very versatile and can be 
  used for medicines, industrial uses, as well as various food uses.
2 Medicine
  The coconut has been used for medicines for 1000's of years in cultures where coconuts grow locally such as Philippines. 
  In traditional medicine, the coconut is used to treat health problems such as asthma, burns, nausea, skin infections and many
  more. Taking a look at modern medicine only confirms everything that the traditional medicine used coconuts for. Modern 
  medicine confirms that the coconut can be used to kill bacteria that cause disease, fungi that cause infections, and even 
  viruses. Coconuts also helps support the body's functions such as the immune system, and utilize body fat more efficiently. 
  The majority of these benefits are found in the coconut's oil! The oil has so many health benefits that it is said to be the 
  most healthies oils on Earth.

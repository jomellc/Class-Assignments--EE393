1 Intro: 
  After weighing in for my boxing match, the coach made sure I drank some coconut water to "recover" from cutting weight. And 
  so I thought "how does a coconut even help recovery?" Being closer to a drupe rather than nut, the coconut is a fruit that 
  comes from palm trees called the cocos nucifera. There are 3 layers to the cococnut; the husk, the hard shell, and the inside
  fleshy part. Although people gernally think of food when it comes to the coconut, it's actually very versatile and can be 
  used for medicines, industrial uses, as well as various food uses.
2 Medicine
  The coconut has been used for medicines for 1000's of years in cultures where coconuts grow locally such as Philippines. 
  In traditional medicine, the coconut is used to treat health problems such as asthma, burns, nausea, skin infections and many
  more. Taking a look at modern medicine only confirms everything that the traditional medicine used coconuts for. Modern 
  medicine confirms that the coconut can be used to kill bacteria that cause disease, fungi that cause infections, and even 
  viruses. Coconuts also helps support the body's functions such as the immune system, and utilize body fat more efficiently. 
  The majority of these benefits are found in the coconut's oil! The oil has so many health benefits that it is said to be the 
  most healthies oils on Earth.
3 Industrial Use
  Along with being used for medicines, coconuts are also processed to make many products for industry using the husk, leaves, 
  and copra. The fibery hairs on the husk is used to make mats, ropes, brushes. In the Philippines they use bunots or dried half 
  coconut shells to buff the floors. The coconut tree leaves have been used to make brooms, baskets, mats, arrows, etc. Finally
  the dried meat of the fruit called the copra is processed to make coconut oil, soaps, cosmetics and massage oil.
4 Food
 The majority of people see the coconuts meat for food, but the coconut can be used for many sort of food products. First off,
 as mentioned earlier, coconut oil can be used for frying food, as well as just for flavor or added nutrients. Coconut water is 
 consumed in all tropical areas and can also be fermented into vinegar. The meat can be eaten raw or become pressed and grated 
 into coconut milk which is used in popular dishes such as curry, and various baked goods.
